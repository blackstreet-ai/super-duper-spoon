# Exa MCP

Exa MCP Server enables AI assistants like Claude to perform real-time web searches through the Exa Search API, allowing them to access up-to-date information from the internet. It is open-source, check out [GitHub](https://github.com/exa-labs/exa-mcp-server/).

## Get your API key

Before you begin, you'll need an Exa API key:

<Card title="Get your Exa API key" icon="key" horizontal href="https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys" />

## Remote Exa MCP

Connect directly to Exa's hosted MCP server using this URL instead of running it locally:

```
https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?exaApiKey=your-exa-api-key
```

To configure Claude Desktop, add this to your configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "exa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp?exaApiKey=your-exa-api-key"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Tools

Exa MCP includes several specialized search tools:

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude to perform searches:

* "Research the company exa.ai and find information about their pricing"
* "Start a deep research project on the impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare, then check when it's complete to get a comprehensive report"

## Local Installation

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher.
* [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed (optional). Exa MCP also works with other MCP-compatible clients like Cursor, Windsurf, and more).
* An Exa API key (see above).

### Using Claude Code

The quickest way to set up Exa MCP is using Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add exa -e EXA_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY -- npx -y exa-mcp-server
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your Exa API key from above.

### Using NPX

The simplest way to install and run Exa MCP is via NPX:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g exa-mcp-server

# Or run directly with npx
npx exa-mcp-server
```

To specify which tools to enable:

```bash
# Enable only web search
npx exa-mcp-server --tools=web_search

# Enable deep researcher tools
npx exa-mcp-server --tools=deep_researcher_start,deep_researcher_check

# List all available tools
npx exa-mcp-server --list-tools
```

## Configuring Claude Desktop

To configure Claude Desktop to use Exa MCP:

1. **Enable Developer Mode in Claude Desktop**
   * Open Claude Desktop
   * Click on the top-left menu
   * Enable Developer Mode

2. **Open the Configuration File**

   * After enabling Developer Mode, go to Settings
   * Navigate to the Developer Option
   * Click "Edit Config" to open the configuration file

   Alternatively, you can open it directly:

   **macOS:**

   ```bash
   code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   **Windows:**

   ```powershell
   code %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

3. **Add Exa MCP Configuration**

   Add the following to your configuration:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "exa": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "-y",
          "exa-mcp-server"
          ],
         "env": {
           "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Exa API key.

4. **Enabling Specific Tools**

   To enable only specific tools:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "exa": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "-y",
           "exa-mcp-server",
           "--tools=web_search"
         ],
         "env": {
           "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   To enable deep researcher tools:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "exa": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "-y",
           "exa-mcp-server",
           "--tools=deep_researcher_start,deep_researcher_check"
         ],
         "env": {
           "EXA_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Restart Claude Desktop**
   * Completely quit Claude Desktop (not just close the window)
   * Start Claude Desktop again
   * Look for the ðŸ”Œ icon to verify the Exa server is connected

## Troubleshooting
